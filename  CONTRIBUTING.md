### 3. Improve the design or UI/UX
You don’t need to be a designer to help make OpenTask look and feel better! Even small suggestions can make a huge difference.

**How to do it:**
- Take a screenshot of any page
- Use your phone or Paint/Canva to draw your idea (arrows, new colors, bigger buttons, etc.)
- Open a new Issue → attach the edited screenshot → explain why it’s better

**Or, if you know Tailwind:**
- Edit the component directly (change classes like `text-sm` → `text-lg`, add `rounded-xl`, etc.)
- Include before/after screenshots in your Pull Request

Even tiny suggestions (better spacing, clearer icons, mobile fixes) are super welcome and will be credited!

We can’t wait to see your ideas ✨

Thank you for making OpenTask better!
